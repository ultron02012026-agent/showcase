      <h2>Workspace Orchestrator</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Chrome Profiles meets AI Agents.</p>

      <p>you know how Chrome profiles keep your work and personal stuff completely separate? same browser, different worlds. now imagine that for AI agents.</p>

      <p>the workspace orchestrator is a design for hierarchical AI workspaces with complete domain isolation. each workspace gets its own identity, tools, browser sessions, credentials, file system, and sub-agent teams. a master orchestrator sits on top and routes requests to the right workspace based on what you're asking.</p>

      <h3>the problem</h3>

      <p>right now, AI assistants are one big blob. your school stuff, work stuff, personal projects, all sharing the same context. same browser. same credentials. ask about a work ticket and the AI has your personal finances in context. it's messy and it's a security problem.</p>

      <h3>the architecture</h3>

      <p>each workspace is a containerized environment. a School workspace has Canvas, GitLab, and Teams with school accounts. a Work workspace has Slack, Jira, and corporate tools with work credentials. Personal has your projects, finance APIs, productivity tools. each one is isolated, no workspace can see another's data.</p>

      <p>the master orchestrator analyzes your intent and routes to the right workspace. "check my grades" goes to School. "what's my portfolio balance" goes to Personal. "summarize the sprint" goes to Work. multi-workspace queries get coordinated, results synthesized, isolation boundaries enforced. the orchestrator never touches tools directly, it delegates.</p>

      <h3>tech stack</h3>

      <p>the design builds on MCP for standardized tool interfaces, Docker for workspace containerization, LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration, and local LLMs for privacy-sensitive inference. about 80% of this could be built today. the remaining 20% is waiting on agentic browser technology and robust multi-agent frameworks to mature, probably 6-12 months out.</p>

      <h3>status</h3>

      <p>this is a design document, not an implementation. the architecture is detailed across four docs covering the master vision, software architecture, hardware specs, and smart glasses research as a client device. it's the blueprint for what a real AI workspace system should look like when the tech catches up.</p>

      <h3>why it matters</h3>

      <p>every company building AI assistants will need workspace isolation eventually. the current "one agent sees everything" model doesn't scale past personal use. this is the architecture that fixes it.</p>
