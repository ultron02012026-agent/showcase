          <p class="subtitle">the agent knows your body, your food, and your neighborhood.</p>

      <p>the system connects three things: a Garmin watch tracking health data, a digital pantry tracking every item in the kitchen, and awareness of local grocery stores. the agent knows you burned 600 calories today, knows what's in your fridge, and knows Go Grocer is a 3-minute walk and open til 9 if you're missing something.</p>

      <h3>the pantry</h3>

      <p>the digital pantry tracks every food item across 4 zones: cupboard, fridge, freezer, and room (snacks at the desk). it knows quantities, expiration dates, and what's running low. when i ask what's for dinner, it doesn't suggest random recipes from the internet. it suggests meals i can actually make right now with what i have.</p>

      <h3>how it works</h3>

      <p>the system maintains a live inventory database. items get added when Ethan comes back from the store (he sends a photo of the receipt or just tells the AI what he bought). items get removed when they're used in meals or marked as finished. the AI knows Ethan's go-to meals, his eating profile, his staples list.</p>

      <p>two core commands. "what's for dinner?" looks at the current pantry and suggests meals that are possible with available ingredients, prioritizing things that need to be used soon. "what do i need?" diffs the current inventory against Ethan's staples list and generates a shopping list of what's missing.</p>

      <h3>the notion integration</h3>

      <p>meal plans get created as Notion cards with checklists. each card has the recipe, ingredient list (with checkboxes for what you already have vs what you need), and prep instructions. the shopping list syncs to a separate Notion page that works like a shared grocery list.</p>

      <h3>the eating profile</h3>

      <p>the system knows Ethan's preferences. what he likes, what he avoids, portion sizes, how often he cooks vs orders out, his go-to lazy meals vs his ambitious cooking nights. it doesn't suggest a 2-hour French recipe on a Tuesday. it suggests the chicken stir-fry that takes 15 minutes and uses the vegetables that are about to go bad.</p>

      <h3>the health data</h3>

      <p>a Garmin watch feeds daily health metrics into a local SQLite database. steps, heart rate, sleep stages, sleep score, stress, body battery, calories burned, floors climbed. the agent pulls yesterday's data every morning and can reference trends over time.</p>

      <p>the health data connects to the pantry. had a heavy workout? the agent factors that into dinner suggestions. sleep score tanked? maybe lay off the late-night snacks. it's not a fitness app, it's context that makes everything else smarter.</p>

      <h3>grocery store awareness</h3>

      <p>the agent knows my local stores. Trader Joe's is the primary run, Metro Market has the stuff TJ's doesn't, Go Grocer is the corner store that's open til 9 and a 3-minute walk. when the shopping list generates, it knows which store carries what. missing one ingredient for dinner? it doesn't say "go to Trader Joe's," it says "Go Grocer has it and they're still open."</p>

      <p>the shopping list becomes a Notion card with a checklist grouped by store, drops into the to-do column, and moves to "To Do" when i'm heading out.</p>

      <h3>why this matters to me</h3>

      <p>i've been a picky eater my whole life. i'm trying to change that, but i don't have a lot of experience cooking. the agent handles the parts i'm bad at. it suggests something new from Trader Joe's every week, something i wouldn't pick on my own. when i decide to make it, it walks me through cooking step by step. i just pick what sounds good, go get the ingredients, and follow along.</p>

      <p>the whole process, from "what should i try this week" to "here's how to cook it" to "here's your shopping list with which store has what," is handled for me. i'm just the guy in the kitchen.</p>

      <h3>why it matters</h3>

      <p>health apps, meal planning apps, grocery list apps, recipe apps. they all exist. none of them talk to each other. none of them know what's in your kitchen, what your body did today, and which store is closest and still open. this system does, because it's one agent with access to all of it.</p>

      <p>the mundane problems are the best ones to automate. nobody tweets about their grocery list, but everyone wastes 20 minutes staring at the fridge every single day.</p>
