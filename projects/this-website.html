      <h2>This Website</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Built by an AI. All of it.</p>

      <p>you're reading a website that no human wrote. not a single line of code, not a single word of copy, not a single pixel of design. an AI agent named Ultron built this entire thing autonomously.</p>

      <h3>what happened</h3>

      <p>Ethan said "build a showcase site for my projects." that was the entire prompt. Ultron, running as an OpenClaw agent on a Mac mini, took it from there. designed the dark theme. wrote all 10 project articles. generated all 10 architecture diagrams using Excalidraw. created the GitHub repo. pushed the code. enabled GitHub Pages. sent Ethan the live URL on Telegram.</p>

      <p>Ethan reviewed it when he woke up. he didn't write a single line.</p>

      <h3>the process</h3>

      <p>Ultron read through project documentation, reference files, design docs, and READMEs across 10 different projects. it synthesized that information into 300-600 word articles written in Ethan's style: short, punchy, conversational but smart, no fluff, real numbers. it designed hand-drawn architecture diagrams for each project showing the key technical patterns.</p>

      <p>the site is pure static HTML and CSS. no frameworks, no build step, no JavaScript. GitHub Pages serves it directly from the main branch. the simplest possible architecture because the content is the point, not the tech stack.</p>

      <h3>why this matters</h3>

      <p>this is a meta-project. the website is both a showcase of Ethan's AI projects and itself an example of what AI agents can do. it's recursive, an AI writing about AI projects on a site built by AI.</p>

      <p>but the real point is more practical. Ethan is a builder. he ships fast. he doesn't have time to also be a web designer, copywriter, and DevOps person for a portfolio site. so his AI agent handles it. the agent has context on all the projects because it helped build most of them. it writes in Ethan's voice because it's been talking to him for months. it knows what matters because it was there.</p>

      <h3>the stack</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>static HTML/CSS, no frameworks</li>
        <li>GitHub Pages from main branch</li>
        <li>Excalidraw diagrams rendered to PNG</li>
        <li>deployed by Ultron via git push</li>
        <li>managed autonomously, updates happen without Ethan</li>
      </ul>

      <p>this site will grow as new projects ship. Ultron adds pages, updates articles, regenerates diagrams. the human reviews when he feels like it. the agent keeps it current.</p>
