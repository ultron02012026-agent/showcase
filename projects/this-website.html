      <p class="subtitle">Ethan's digital garden. AI-assisted.</p>

      <p>every decision on this site is Ethan's. what projects to feature, how they're framed, the design direction, the tone. Ultron is the execution partner, helps think through the design at a high level, writes the code, handles deployment. but Ethan drives.</p>

      <h3>how it started</h3>

      <p>Ethan was laying in bed at 2am and had the idea. he texted Ultron on Telegram: "what if we made a project showcase website." then he specced it out, design direction, which projects to include, the vibe he wanted. five minutes of him making decisions over text.</p>

      <p>Ultron helped design the layout and built the first version in about 15 minutes. 10 project articles, architecture diagrams, GitHub Pages deployment. then Ethan reviewed it on his phone and started directing revisions. "make it white, not dark." "add a pill nav that morphs when you scroll." he knows what he wants, the AI helps him get there faster.</p>

      <p>that's the pattern for everything on this site. Ethan comes up with the idea, makes the calls, reviews the output, and revises until it's right. Ultron helps him design and build at speed.</p>

      <h3>the digital garden</h3>

      <p>this isn't a static portfolio. it's a living document that grows as Ethan ships new projects. he decides what gets added, how it reads, what the narrative is. Ultron drafts, Ethan edits until it sounds like him.</p>

      <p>the articles are in Ethan's voice: short, punchy, conversational, real numbers, no fluff. Ultron has context on every project because he helped build most of them, but the thinking and the decisions are Ethan's.</p>

      <h3>the stack</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS, no frameworks</li>
        <li>GitHub Pages from main branch</li>
        <li>Excalidraw diagrams rendered to PNG</li>
        <li>deployed via git push</li>
        <li>idea to first version: ~20 minutes over Telegram</li>
        <li>every change goes through Ethan's review</li>
      </ul>

      <p>it's a simple site on purpose. the content is what matters. Ethan's ideas, built at the speed of AI.</p>
