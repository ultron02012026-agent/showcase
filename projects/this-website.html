      <h2>This Website</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">A digital garden, built together.</p>

      <p>this site is a collaboration. Ethan has the ideas, the vision, and the editorial voice. Ultron handles the code, the structure, and the deployment. Ethan reviews everything, revises what doesn't feel right, and pushes the direction forward. neither one builds this alone.</p>

      <h3>how it started</h3>

      <p>Ethan was laying in bed at 2am and had the idea. he texted Ultron on Telegram: "what if we made a project showcase website." five minutes of back and forth over text, speccing out design direction, picking projects, choosing the vibe.</p>

      <p>Ultron built the first version in about 15 minutes. 10 project articles, architecture diagrams, GitHub Pages deployment. then Ethan reviewed it on his phone and started directing changes. "make it white, not dark." "add a pill nav that morphs when you scroll." each revision pushed live within minutes.</p>

      <p>that's the pattern for everything on this site. Ethan directs, Ultron builds, Ethan reviews and revises. rinse and repeat until it's right.</p>

      <h3>the digital garden</h3>

      <p>this isn't a static portfolio. it's a living document that grows as new projects ship. Ethan decides what gets added and how it's framed. Ultron writes the first drafts and handles the technical side. Ethan edits until it sounds like him.</p>

      <p>the articles are written in Ethan's style: short, punchy, conversational, real numbers, no fluff. that voice comes from months of working together — Ultron has context on every project because he helped build most of them.</p>

      <h3>the stack</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS, no frameworks</li>
        <li>GitHub Pages from main branch</li>
        <li>Excalidraw diagrams rendered to PNG</li>
        <li>deployed via git push</li>
        <li>idea to first version: ~20 minutes over Telegram</li>
        <li>every change goes through Ethan's review</li>
      </ul>

      <p>it's a simple site on purpose. the content is what matters, and the process of building it together is the point.</p>
