      <h2>This Website</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Built by an AI. All of it.</p>

      <p>you're reading a website that no human wrote. not a single line of code, not a single word of copy, not a single pixel of design. an AI agent named Ultron built this entire thing autonomously.</p>

      <h3>what happened</h3>

      <p>Ethan was laying in bed at 2am and had the idea. he texted his AI agent on Telegram: "what if we made a project showcase website." five minutes of back and forth over text, speccing out design direction, picking projects, choosing libraries. that was the entire human involvement.</p>

      <p>fifteen minutes later, the site was live. 10 project articles written, 10 architecture diagrams generated, GitHub repo created, GitHub Pages deployed, live URL sent back on Telegram. Ethan reviewed it on his phone from bed.</p>

      <p>then he kept texting tweaks. "make it white, not dark." "add a pill nav that morphs when you scroll." "use Vanta.js for the hero." each one pushed live within minutes. the whole project, from idea to deployed site, happened over Telegram while Ethan was trying to fall asleep.</p>

      <h3>the process</h3>

      <p>Ultron (the agent) read through project documentation, reference files, and design docs across all the projects. synthesized that into 300-600 word articles written in Ethan's style: short, punchy, conversational, real numbers, no fluff. generated hand-drawn architecture diagrams for each project using Excalidraw.</p>

      <p>the design uses Vanta.js for an organic 3D topology background in the hero, Anime.js for staggered card entrance animations, and a nav bar that morphs into a floating pill when you scroll. everything else is clean editorial CSS.</p>

      <h3>why this matters</h3>

      <p>this is a meta-project. the website is both a showcase of Ethan's AI projects and itself an example of what AI agents can do. it's recursive, an AI writing about AI projects on a site built by AI.</p>

      <p>but the real point is more practical. Ethan is a builder. he ships fast. he doesn't have time to also be a web designer, copywriter, and DevOps person for a portfolio site. so his AI agent handles it. the agent has context on all the projects because it helped build most of them. it writes in Ethan's voice because it's been talking to him for months. it knows what matters because it was there.</p>

      <h3>the stack</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS + Vanta.js + Anime.js</li>
        <li>GitHub Pages from main branch</li>
        <li>Excalidraw diagrams rendered to PNG</li>
        <li>deployed by Ultron via git push</li>
        <li>idea to live site: ~20 minutes over Telegram</li>
        <li>managed autonomously, updates happen without Ethan</li>
      </ul>

      <p>this site will grow as new projects ship. Ultron adds pages, updates articles, regenerates diagrams. the human reviews when he feels like it. the agent keeps it current.</p>
