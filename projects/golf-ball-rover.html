      <h2>Golf Ball Retriever Rover</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">A Raspberry Pi 5 rover that fetches your golf balls.</p>

      <p>i practice putting from 25 feet away in my apartment. the annoying part isn't missing, it's walking over to get the ball. so i built a rover to do it.</p>

      <p>say "go get the ball" and a 4-wheel drive rover wakes up from its home base by the kitchen island, scans for a white circle on the carpet using computer vision, drives over, scoops the ball, and brings it back. the whole thing runs locally on a Raspberry Pi 5. no cloud, no API calls, no latency.</p>

      <h3>the brain</h3>

      <p>ball detection is OpenCV running at 30fps on the Pi. color threshold plus contour detection for a white circle on carpet. it works because a golf ball on apartment carpet is one of the easiest vision problems you can solve, high contrast, consistent shape, predictable environment.</p>

      <p>navigation is a continuous PID control loop. the camera sees where the ball is, left, center, right, near, far, and adjusts motor speeds in real-time. about 5-10 seconds to reach a ball 25 feet away. for the return trip, it scans for a pink duct tape marker on the floor. way more reliable than dead reckoning.</p>

      <h3>the scoop</h3>

      <p>originally planned a robot arm with a claw gripper. terrible idea for golf balls. smooth, round, hard to grip, top-heavy mechanism, multiple servos, unreliable. pivoted to a servo-actuated scoop channel: tilt down, drive into ball, tilt up, ball captured. one SG90 servo, lower center of gravity, mechanically simple, and forgiving even with slightly off-center approaches.</p>

      <h3>the build</h3>

      <p>total cost: ~$233 from Amazon. Freenove 4WD Smart Car Kit for the chassis and motors, Raspberry Pi 5 as the brain, Arducam camera, USB speaker for personality ("OW!" when it hits something), and a INIU power bank to prevent voltage sag when the Pi 5 spikes to 5A under motor load.</p>

      <p>the AI agent (Ultron, running on a Mac mini) SSHes into the rover to start and stop scripts. golf mode activates via Telegram command or voice. the real-time driving loop is all local on the Pi, Ultron handles the high-level commands and error recovery.</p>

      <h3>what's next</h3>

      <p>software is complete. hardware is ordered. beyond golf: "go check if i left the stove on," apartment patrol when away, party tricks. any task where an AI agent needs eyes and wheels in the room.</p>
