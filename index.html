        <h3>OpenClaw Review</h3>
        <p>After a week with OpenClaw, the open-source AI agent framework, Ethan's verdict: this is bigger than ChatGPT. Not because it's smarter, but because it changes the relationship from "I sit down and prompt it" to "it's always running and I just text it." Starts with a Govee API key and ends with feel-the-AGI moments.</p>

        <h3>Claude Royale</h3>
        <p>AI playing Clash Royale autonomously. Multi-agent system with a Commander orchestrating 3 parallel Players per match, each making independent elixir and card placement decisions in real-time. Streamed 12+ hours on Twitch, hit 1000+ trophies, played 14 games without human intervention. The hardest part was teaching it that the result screen says "WINNER!" even on losses.</p>

        <h3>House Agents</h3>
        <p>Sub-agent framework that quarantines heavy operations into isolated context windows and returns only condensed results. 187,000 tokens go into agent contexts, roughly 5,000 come back. That's 95-98% token reduction across four agents: research, git, bash, and MCP. The main context stays sharp because it never sees the mess.</p>

        <h3>Golf Ball Retriever Rover</h3>
        <p>Raspberry Pi 5 autonomous rover that retrieves golf balls from putting practice. OpenCV runs locally at 30fps for ball detection, PID control loop handles navigation, and a servo-actuated scoop picks up the ball. Software was complete before the $233 Amazon order even arrived. The AI wrote the whole stack from a Reddit post about golf ball retrievers.</p>

        <div class="tag tag-dj">DJ / AI</div>
        <h3>DJ Sam</h3>
        <p>An AI DJ agent running as its own OpenClaw instance with its own Telegram bot, workspace, memory, and identity. Manages a 502-track, 10GB music library downloaded from Google Drive. Purchases tracks on Beatport with Apple Card virtual numbers, imports into Rekordbox via pyrekordbox. Has its own purchasing workflow and talks to other agents.</p>

        <h3>DJ Lighting System</h3>
        <p>Govee smart lights integrated with DJ sets. 12 curated scene rotations designed for deep and tech house, cycling every 32 bars at 130 BPM. Phase 1 is done, future phases include reading real-time BPM and beat position from a Pioneer XDJ-XZ over ethernet via Pro DJ Link, plus phrase-based scene changes and BPM-synced pulse.</p>

        <h3>DJ Track Acquisition</h3>
        <p>Automated track sourcing for weekend DJ sets. Find tracks on Spotify during the week, the system searches SoundCloud for free downloads first, then Beatport and Bandcamp for purchases. Browser automation handles the checkout flow. Always grabs extended versions. The goal is a Thursday evening auto-run that has everything ready before Friday.</p>

        <div class="tag tag-life">Life / AI</div>
        <h3>Digital Pantry</h3>
        <p>Meal planning system with a digital pantry tracking inventory across four zones: cupboard, fridge, freezer, and room. Say "what's for dinner?" and it suggests meals from what you actually have. Say "what do I need from the store?" and it diffs your pantry against your staples list, generates a Notion card with a checklist grouped by store.</p>

        <h3>The Library</h3>
        <p>Killed Audible in 30 minutes. The AI agent sourced the PDF, chunked it into chapters, ran each through ElevenLabs TTS, and served the audio as an RSS feed on port 8282 via a launchd service. Subscribe in Apple Podcasts and every book shows up as a podcast with chapters as episodes. 6 books in the library. Built while the human was at the gym.</p>

        <h3>AI Engineering Manager</h3>
        <p>Ship features from the couch via Telegram. Text an idea, the agent asks clarifying questions, analyzes the codebase through a sub-agent, creates a GitHub issue with an implementation plan, spawns an isolated Claude Code session to write the code, opens a PR into staging, and notifies you when it's ready. The orchestrator never reads code directly. Ralph Loops pattern: fresh instance per task, test, commit, repeat.</p>

        <h3>This Website</h3>
        <p>You're looking at it. The idea came at 2am laying in bed. Ethan specced the design, picked the projects, chose the vibe, and directed every revision over Telegram. Ultron helped design the layout and wrote the code. It's a digital garden — Ethan decides what goes on it and how it reads, the AI helps him build it faster.</p>
