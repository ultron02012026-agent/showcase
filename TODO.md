# Website To-Do 🔥

## "Copy Architecture" button
- Mysterious button at the bottom of applicable articles
- No explanation, no label beyond the button itself. Just: **copy architecture**
- Copies a hidden prompt to clipboard — the full abstracted architecture
- Reader has no idea what it is until they paste it into AI
- Curiosity-driven. Zero friction. No tutorial.
- The prompt itself strips Ethan's specifics, gives pure architecture
- Not every article needs one — only the ones with replicable systems

## New article: Context-Aware PRD Skill
- Deep dive on the engineering manager pattern
- How the skill reads codebase via sub-agent, asks clarifying questions
- Writes full PRD with implementation plan, spawns Claude Code to build
- Why it's so powerful: code awareness without context pollution
- This is the most enabling pattern we've built

## New article: CRM / Outreach System
- Abstract the artist finder into a general-purpose CRM article
- Focus on architecture: automated outreach, email sequences, tracking
- Don't make it about music — make it about the pattern

## Blue "how could AI do this?" motif
- Add a signature moment in every article where "how could AI do this?" appears bold and in the accent blue
- Match it in the hero copy too — make "how could AI do this?" blue
- Recurring theme tying the whole site together
- Needs Ethan's review: find the natural moment in each article where the question fits
- Add CSS class for it (e.g. .signature-question { color: var(--accent-1); font-weight: 700; })

## Security article
- After Beryl router setup, write article about the full security stack

## Article review
- Ethan reads through all articles, marks tweaks
- Reframe "This Website" article as collaboration

## OpenClaw review
- Already added, Ethan needs to review and revise
